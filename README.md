# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary
**In 1-2 sentences, explain the problem statement: e.g "This dataset contains data about... we seek to predict..."**

This dataset contains data about individual banking information. We seek to predict whether or not, an individual would have their loan approved. The best performing model was a voting ensemble**

## Scikit-learn Pipeline
The first model trained was fitted using the following pipeline:

1. Load the data from a `.csv` using the `TabularDatasetFactory` class
2. Clean the data and proceed with variable encoding
3. Split the data into a `train` and `test` pandas dataframe
4. Proceed with a logistic regression (with the hyperparameter `C` (penalization parameter) optimized using a random search from the uniform distribution between 0 and 50)

The random search for hyperparameter tuning allows for a faster optimization. By experience, the gain from using other hyperparameter techniques for only 1 parameter is marginal. 

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

0.9121 logistic avec hyperdrive

0.9149 voting ensemble



## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**
